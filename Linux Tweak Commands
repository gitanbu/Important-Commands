journal logs
=============

Yes you can delete everything inside of /var/log/journal/* but do not delete the directory itself. You can also query journalctl to find out how much disk space it's consuming:

$ journalctl --disk-usage
Journals take up 3.8G on disk.
You can control the size of this directory using this parameter in your /etc/systemd/journald.conf:

SystemMaxUse=50M
You can force a log rotation:

$ sudo systemctl kill --kill-who=main --signal=SIGUSR2 systemd-journald.service
NOTE: You might need to restart the logging service to force a log rotation, if the above signaling method does not do it. You can restart the service like so:

$ sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald.service

  Size based 
journalctl --vacuum-size=500M

  Time Based
journalctl --vacuum-time=5d

  Remove entire Journal log
find /var/log/journal -name "*.journal" | xargs sudo rm
